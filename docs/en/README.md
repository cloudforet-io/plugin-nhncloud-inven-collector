This setup guide will take a closer look at what the above-mentioned information means and where to obtain it.
<br>

### Username
**Username** is the ID you use when you login into NHN Console IAM.
<br>

### Tenant ID
**Tenant ID** is a **unique identifier** for your organization provided by NHN Cloud Services.
Tenant ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service that you use to manage users on an organizational basis. It is used to manage IaaS resources and issuing tokens to access resources.
<br>

### Password
**Password** is the password you use for login in default. But you can manage to set password for paticular services such as Compute Instance or Object Storage.
<br>

### APP Key
**APP Key** is the key that can be obtained through NHN Cloud project management settings. Integrated project Appkey is applied for authentication of NHN Cloud Service.
Required when using NHN Cloud's API of PaaS resources.
<br>

### User Access Key ID
This is the User ID that is required for user authentication to use the NHN Cloud service.
Required when using RDS and Certificate Manager resources.
<br>

### Secret Access Key
This is the Secret Key that is required for user authentication to use the NHN Cloud service.
Required when using RDS and Certificate Manager resources.
<br>

### Storage Account
This is the **Account** that can be obtained through Object Storage Service.
Required when using Object Storage resources.
<br>

### Email Secret Key
This is the Secret Key that is required for Email resources.
<br>

### Push Secret Key
This is the Secret Key that is required for Push resources.
<br>

We briefly discussed the concept of setup information required when registering a Cloudforet NHN Cloud service account.
Now, let's learn more about **how to actually obtain configuration information** in the next lesson.
